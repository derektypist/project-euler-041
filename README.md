# Project Euler 041 - Pandigital Prime

We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once.  For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is also prime.

The aim is to find the largest n-digit pandigital prime that exists, using HTML Forms and JavaScript.
